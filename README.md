Maze/Graph Modeling Project
==========================
*Find the shortest path through a 3D maze using Python and NetworkX*

For the project, we created one file: maze.py for running the maze problem program. For this program we will use console input, so in the maze.py file between lines 105 to 107, I have included a way to open and read the required input.txt file. To run the maze problem program simply enter in your terminal:

* python maze.py

This program will output the computed path in a file called maynes.txt. Also, the program will show a console output that should contain the same output as contained in the maynes.txt file.
